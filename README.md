# capstone-3.0.3

In this project, we are extending Capstone to parse iOS Mach-O executables.

The code is mainly in the test folder: m_loader, parse_mach, main, etc. You should be able to compile it with "make all" and run "main" to generate a JSON report for a Mach-O executable.

This code is not meant to be open-sourced, so it is not well organized. However, hopefully, it will be helpful to someone who tries to parse Mach-O.
